# Bankruptcy-Classification

Given a dataset of miscellaneous financial performance metrics, I used various machine learning techniques and fine tuned models to achieve a high accuracy predictive model for the likelihood of bankruptcy among firms. 

-OBJECTIVES-

-To use econometric data and financial information to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy for any given firm

-Run machine learning models in SAS EM to identify best possible model on training set. 

-Maximize binary classification accuracy metric - ROC/AUC score


-METHODOLOGY-

- Preprocessed dataset using transformation and replacement techniques where required

- Employed Logistic regression, Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Adaptive Lasso, Neural Networks & Ensemble Methods for model building

- Compared model accuracies using model comparison feature in SAS EM to analyze ROC curve and AUC.
